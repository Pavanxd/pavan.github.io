  To summarize our observations, one section of our observation collection was centered around the school's usage of FirstClass. We both knew that much of the school has expressed their dissatisfaction with the email application so we wanted to look at that for a portion of our lab. We noted down that FirstClass was marred with glitches, with indicators being things such as FirstClass duplicating received/sent emails on occasion. Furthermore, another functionality we found to be inconvenient for students was that FirstClass deleted emails after 30 days. From class, we also observed that the computers in the computer lab were inconvenient in that they took too long to load when signing in. Furthermore, with other seniors, we focused on the college process, and the communication between seniors and their college counselors. We noticed that sometimes, seniors complained that communication was not streamlined enough with their counselors. For these observations, one could easily group them under an umbrella class of observations derived from online interactions. We made our observations based around the theme of long-distance digital communication, so that we could directly address them through application development.
