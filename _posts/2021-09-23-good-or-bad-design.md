  I personally believe that the New York Times website above, is an example of good design. The contrast of black on a white background makes the website seem clean, and even uncluttered. Furthermore, the contrast of colors contributes to the visibility of each article or even link of interest, helping any given user navigate through the website fairly easily. Combined with this, importance and size of article title on the webpage are directly correlated, meaning that the most 'important' news of the day is front and center, with the largest/most visible headline. This helps users quickly access the most important information they need for the day ahead (to stay informed).

  I think the example above is an example of bad design. I think the general format of the square-like previews for the posts are too large, taking too much of the home page. Furthermore, the previews of the awards given to posters make the previews for posts a bit too convoluted, and cluttered. I also believe that the placement of the advertisement on the right side is too large, and it could confuse users into thinking that it is an actual preivew of a post, rather than an advertisement.
